## About this project

The purpose of this project was to create a random password generator with selectable length and charcter type inclusion. Upon clicking "generate password" the user must select a length between 8-128, and atleast one of the following: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters. The application will return an error and return to start if the user enters a number outside of the range or does not make a selection. After each selection, the application will modify the character bank from which the output will be randomly selected. Upon completion, the password generated will be displayed in the text field. The user may chose to generate another password at this point.
